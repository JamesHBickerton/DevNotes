# REACT NOTES 2025

- State is the most important concept in React. Whenever we need something to change in the UI, we change the state.
- JSX is similar to HTML, but we can add JS to it. To enter 'JS mode' you would use the curly braces in your code. 
- `useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
