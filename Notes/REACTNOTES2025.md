# REACT NOTES 2025

- State is the most important concept in React. Whenever we need something to change in the UI, we change the state.
- JSX is similar to HTML, but we can add JS to it. To enter 'JS mode' you would use the curly braces in your code. 
- `useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
- Pieces of data are called pieces of state. 
- `useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system. It takes 2 arguments - first a function, and the dependancy array.
- In React we try to divide user interfaces into components. All components should start with a capital letter i.e. below: 
`function Message() { return CODE }`
- <strong>Problems with using Vanilla JS</strong> - 
<ol>
<li>It requires a lot of direct DOM manipulation and DOM traversing - this means that making bigger projects you would have a HUGE mess of code.</li>
  <li>Data/state is usually stored in the DOM, which can cause a lot of bugs.</li>
</ol>
- Front-end frameworks make it easier for us to keep UI and DATA in sync over time. They also give developers a consistent way of building front-end applications.
