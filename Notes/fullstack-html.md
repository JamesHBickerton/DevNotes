## Frontend Development

### HTML
- Notes on structure and semantics that I haven't included on my initial devnotes.
- `<hr />` and `<br />` elements are void elements. The hr will make a horizontal line and the br element will make a break in the line. But only use these sparingly due to accessibility issues.
- `../dog.png` will mean that the file directory needs to go further up the "file tree" whereas `./dog.png` means it will stay at the current directory/file path (the folder your png img is in). 


- Key elements and their uses

### CSS
- Styling basics
- Layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid, etc.)
- Responsive design
